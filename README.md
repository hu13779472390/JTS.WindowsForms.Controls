A ConfirmationButton for Windows Forms applications

ConfirmationButton is a simple button that forces the user to confirm an action to prevent unintended results. Such as when deleting sensitive or important information or files, accepting terms and conditions or privacy policies, etc. The ConfirmationButton can also behave as a regular button.

This button is customizable.

In order to customize the appearance of this button, simply add it to your form, open up the Properties pane and change the BackgroundColor, HighlightColor, ActiveColor, BorderColor, ConfirmedBackgroundColor, ConfirmedBorderColor, Separator (Size), et al. to your liking.

If you would like this button to behave as a Confirmation button, you must set its RequiresConfirmation property to true - in the Properties pane, or from within your own code.

Note:
If you are using the button to attain Agreement or Confirmation, you must handle the Confirmed event. You can do this from within the Properties pane or from within your code.
